## Cars Database

**This project is a database/management system for cars.**

- The user can use a form to input the basic details of their vehicle  
  and use buttons to add the car to the database or reset the form.

- The application informs the user if the data is entered incorrectly  
  before it allows the car to be added (input validity and error handling).

- The added cars are stored as class objects in an array and  
  also saved in the browser's local storage API (added car data remains  
  visible even when the browser is refreshed/closed).

- Each car's input details are displayed on a new row in a table visible on the page.  
  The table also displays a discounted price calculated for older cars,  
  the date the car has been added, and a button to delete the car from the database.

- The user can use search functionality to find cars by their licence numbers.  
  If found, the details of the stored car are retrieved from local storage  
  and displayed on the page.

- The application's design and functionality work  
  on both desktop and mobile devices.

- Built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
